    "This project explores what can be learned from an extensive housing dataset that is embedded in a dense social context in Cook County, Illinois.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project A1 (this assignment), we will guide you through some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the data. Next, you will be adding a few new features to the dataset, while cleaning the data as well in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project A2 (the following assignment), you will specify and fit a linear model for the purpose of prediction. Finally, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance.\n",

    "## Grading\n",
    "Grading is broken down into auto-graded answers and free responses. For auto-graded answers, the results of your code are compared to provided and/or hidden tests. For free response, readers will evaluate how well you answered the question and/or fulfilled the requirements of the question. \n",
