    "## 1. Understanding the Dataset\n",
    "The source dataset comes from https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/chatbot_arena_conversations. The author describes the dataset as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> This dataset contains 33K cleaned conversations with pairwise human preferences. It is collected from 13K unique IP addresses on the Chatbot Arena from April to June 2023. Each sample includes a question ID, two model names, their full conversation text in OpenAI API JSON format, the user vote, the anonymized user ID, the detected language tag, the OpenAI moderation API tag, the additional toxic tag, and the timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/) is a platform where users can ask questions and two chatbots will provide answers. The user then votes on which chatbot provided the best answer. The dataset contains the questions, the answers, and the user votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conversation Data**\n",
    "You can find the processed dataset in `./chatbot-arena-conversations.jsonl.gz`. The dataset is in JSON line format and compressed using gzip. It has gone through the following preprocessing steps to make analysis easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Removed non-English conversations.\n",
    "    - Removed conversations with more than one round.\n",
    "    - Removed conversations classified as toxic or harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will be working with contains `25282` rows (out of `33000` total rows) and `7` columns. The columns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `question_id`: A unique identifier for the question.\n",
    "- `model_a`: The name of the first chatbot model.\n",
    "- `model_b`: The name of the second chatbot model.\n",
    "- `winner`: The name of the chatbot model that won the user vote.\n",
    "- `judge`: The anonymized user ID that voted.\n",
    "- `conversation_a`: The conversation between the user and `model_a`.\n",
    "- `conversation_b`: The conversation between the user and `model_b`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Embedding Data**\n",
    "    - `./chatbot-arena-prompts-embeddings.npy` contains the 256-dimensional text embeddings for each of the human questions. The embeddings are generated using OpenAI’s text-embedding model. We will explain what embeddings are and how you can use them later.\n",
    "    - `./chatbot-arena-model_a_response-embeddings.npy` contains the 256-dimensional text embeddings for each of the model a responses (second half of conversation a). The embeddings are generated using OpenAI’s text-embedding model. \n",
    "     - `./chatbot-arena-model_b_response-embeddings.npy` contains the 256-dimensional text embeddings for each of of the model b responses (second half of conversation b). The embeddings are generated using OpenAI’s text-embedding model.\n",

    " contains labels for the dataset, which you can use for later modeling tasks. It has the following fields:\n",
    "  - **question_id**: The unique identifier for the question, as seen in `./chatbot-arena-conversations.jsonl.gz`.\n",
    "  - **prompt**: The extracted human question. This is equivalent to the first message in `conversation_a` and `conversation_b` in `./chatbot-arena-conversations.jsonl.gz`.\n",

    "    - The score value\n",
